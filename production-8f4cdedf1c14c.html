cancer immunotherapy focuses on activation of the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Some of the immunotherapies currently being adopted in clinical trials include targeting of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-L1 and CTLA4), utilizing bi-specific
antibodies, and incorporating adoptive cell transfers (e.g., Chimeric Antigenic Receptor (CAR) T Cells). As biopharmaceutical companies continue to design and develop immunotherapies, the need to assess the efficacies of these therapies grows. The HematogenixÂ®
clinical, scientific and project management teams serve our biopharma partners as they advance these therapies."}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"bdaa4900d901","markDefs":[]},{"style":"normal","_key":"7d9af645ebd1","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"1d77630f1cc60","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Hematogenix

through concordance studies in various indications. Through collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies, we have published concordance studies on commercially available PD-L1 clones in respected peer reviewed journals, in an effort to provide insight
to harmonization of the PD-L1 diagnostic assays.
